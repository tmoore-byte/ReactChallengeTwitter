# Mini Challenge - Twitter

In this mini challenge, you will mainly be modifying the React code to add functionality instead of just modifying the CSS. Some CSS modification may be necessary.

You've been given a semi-complete Tweet component and need to modify the code to compelete the following requirements:

1. Clicking on each interaction (reply, share, like) will add one to the number displayed next to that icon. (But only for the tweet that was clicked)

2. The <App /> component maps through an array of Tweet objects and displays at least 3 different tweets.

3. At least one tweet is by an unVerified user, and the verified check mark icon is not displayed on that Tweet component. Use the "isVerified" prop for this.
